My name is Vince Carrillo, a 20 year old sophomore studying Software Engineering. I enjoy playing video games, working out, and 
learning new technologies. During my time at NAU, I've been working full-time as a Beverage Merchandiser in order to not be homeless. I also have a cat, his name's Salem! :D
