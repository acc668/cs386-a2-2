## Introduction
Our project is a web-based reservation system designed for students in the AML, enabling them to book specific PCs for competitive play, while still allowing casual players to use the space without disruption. This software ensures fair and efficient access to gaming resources by allowing competitive players to secure dedicated time slots, while notifying current users when a computer is reserved. Casual players can continue using available PCs without worrying about sudden disruptions or being forced to switch computers.
By streamlining the reservation process and preventing conflicts, our solution supports both competitive and casual players, fostering an organized and inclusive gaming environment.

## Initial Value Proposition & Customer Segment(s)
The Advanced Media Lab is a high-traffic on-campus computer lab.
Our scheduling software, **Q-up**, is designed to reduce student frustration when the lab reaches full capacity. While not a necessity, **Q-up** enhances convenience for students seeking to use the AML. Our primary audience is AML attendees, but the software can also help encourage broader use by other students and faculty.
What sets **Q-up** apart is its real-time updates, allowing users to monitor PC availability and minimize scheduling conflicts.

## Final Value Proposition & Customer Segment(s)
The Advanced Media Lab is a high-traffic on-campus computer lab with a diverse user base, ranging from competitive esports players to casual gamers. Our scheduling software, Q-up, is designed to streamline access to the lab's resources, helping both types of users avoid frustration when the lab reaches full capacity.
For competitive players, Q-up offers a clear advantage by allowing teams to reserve specific PCs, ensuring they have dedicated space for their sessions without disruptions. Casual gamers will benefit from notifications warning them about team reservations, which helps them avoid being unexpectedly booted off their computers.
Q-up also offers essential features like an easily accessible, web-based interface, mobile notifications, and real-time updates. These features not only allow users to monitor PC availability but also provide timed alerts, enabling better planning and minimizing scheduling conflicts. With options for team captains to directly reserve spots and customized alerts, Q-up fosters a more organized, inclusive, and efficient gaming environment.
While Q-up is primarily aimed at AML attendees, its features are designed to encourage wider adoption by other students and faculty, enhancing overall lab usage.
